# Create dataset

In order to train a model we need to provide it with a lot of documents. The easiest way to do this, is to bundle multiple documents together in the form of [_datasets_](../concepts/datasets.md). Before we start uploading documents, let's create a dataset to hold all of them together.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you upload documents without assigning them to a dataset, or you want to change the dataset in the future, this is possible to change easily using the API. However, it is a lot easier to upload them directly to a dataset right away!
{% endhint %}

Insert direct link to Cradl that takes you to datasets

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}
```python
