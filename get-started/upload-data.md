# Upload data

When we have a dataset, we can start uploading documents and ground truths that will be used to train your model.
There are three different ways of uploading data, choose the one that suits your needs!

### [Using the App](upload-data-app.md)
If you have downloaded the Cradl application you can just drag and drop files as described [here](upload-data-app.md).

### [Using the CLI](upload-data-using-cli.md)
If you want to upload documents programatically using the CLI [this](upload-data-using-cli.md) is a good place to start.
