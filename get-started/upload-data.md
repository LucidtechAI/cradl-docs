# Upload data

There are three different ways of uploading data, choose the one that suits your needs!

### [From the app](upload-data-app.md)
If you have downloaded the Cradl application you can just drag and drop files as described [here](upload-data-app.md).

### [One document at the time](upload-data-one-by-one.md)
If you just want to upload a couple of documents to see how it works [this](upload-data-one-by-one.md) is a good place to start.

### [Upload multiple documents](upload-data-create-documents.md)
If you want to upload a full dataset we have support for uploading an entire folder [here](upload-data-create-documents.md).
