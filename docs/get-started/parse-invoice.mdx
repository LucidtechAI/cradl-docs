# Parsing invoices and receipts

This is a short demonstration of how you can parse an invoice or receipt in Cradl. 

## Sign up to Cradl

Before you start you need to [sign up](https://app.cradl.ai/login?redirect=signup&utm_campaign=docs) for a free 
account.

## Parse invoice or receipt

Choose which method you wish to use for parsing below.

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="WebApp" label="WebApp" default>

Go to one of our pre-trained models in the model overview and select the one you wish to use for document parsing. You
can upload your own document or choose from between one of our sample documents for testing.

<h3> Create API credentials and install CLI </h3>

Make sure you have Cradl API credentials and Python version 3.6 or newer installed on your computer. To get API 
credentials, go to [app clients](https://app.cradl.ai/appclients) and create an app client. Download the file 
containing client ID, client secret and api endpoints. The file should be named `credentials.cfg`. Then follow the 
instructions [here](../overview/authentication#credentialscfg) to put `credentials.cfg` in the correct folder on your 
computer and follow the instructions [here](../overview/installation) to install the CLI.

<h3> Use CLI to parse documents </h3>

In order to parse an invoice in Cradl we need to make two API calls, one that uploads a 
[document](../concepts/documents) and another that parses it and creates [predictions](../concepts/predictions). The 
second API call requires you to provide a `modelId`. If you are using one of our pre-trained models they are 
`las:organization:cradl/las:model:invoice` and `las:organization:cradl/las:model:receipt` for the invoice and receipt 
models respectively. You can use these as a quick test, but we recommend training your own customized model for 
production usage. Read more about how to train a high accuracy model 
[here](../get-started/how-to-train-a-high-accuracy-model-on-large-datasets)

```bash
las documents create <your invoice.pdf>
las predictions create <documentId> las:organization:cradl/las:model:invoice
```

:::info
See the [confidence section](../concepts/predictions.mdx#confidence) to read more about confidence levels and how you can use them to feel confident in your model's predictions.

<h3> Parsing invoices with Postman </h3>

This is a short demonstration of how you can parse an invoice in Cradl using our 
[Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/cradlai).

## Sign up to Cradl and create API credentials

To begin you'll need to [sign up](https://app.cradl.ai/login?redirect=signup&utm_campaign=docs) and create an 
[app client](https://app.cradl.ai/appclients) and download the file containing client ID and client secret. These
values are needed for authorization when using the API.

## Configure authorization in Postman

Go to our [postman page](https://www.postman.com/cradlai) and locate our API listed under the "APIs" tab. There should 
only be one API there named "Cradl". Fork the Collection and navigate to the Authorization settings of the collection
as shown below.

![Fork collection](/img/postman/postman0.png)

Edit the Client ID and Client Secret and add the values for client ID and client secret that you downloaded in the 
Cradl app from the previous step. When you are done adding your client ID and secret, click on the 
"Get New Access Token" button and validate that you are getting an "Access Token". Then click the "Use Token" button in 
the dialog that appears.

## Upload and parse an image or PDF invoice

In order to parse an invoice in Cradl we need to make two API calls, one that uploads a 
[document](../concepts/documents) and another that parses it and creates [predictions](../concepts/predictions).

To upload a document we need to invoke `POST /documents` with a JSON payload containing the image or PDF as a base64 
encoded string together with its content mime type. Cradl supports `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/tiff` and
`application/pdf` content types. Since there is no easy way of converting a file to base64 directly in Postman, we'll 
show how you can achieve this using the `base64` program on linux.

```bash
$ base64 <invoice filename> -w 0
```

Copy the output and paste it in the JSON body as the value of the key "content" and put the corresponding mime type as 
value for the key "contentType", ignore all other parameters for now. Note the `documentId` from the API JSON response 
body as we'll need this value for the next part.

![POST /documents](/img/postman/postman3.png)

:::info
If you get an "Unauthorized" response from the API, click on the "Authorization" tab of the request. "Type" should be
"Inherit auth from parent", but due to a limitation in Postman we'll have to reselect "Inherit auth from parent" for 
the request to update headers from configuring Client ID and secret earlier.
:::

Finally, we are ready to create predictions on our invoice and to do that you'll need to invoke `POST /predictions`
with `documentId` from the previous step and with a `modelId`. The `modelId` determines which 
[model](../concepts/models) we are using to create predictions. Cradl offers several out-of-the-box models that you can
use, and they have deterministic values for `modelId`, namely `las:organization:cradl/las:model:invoice` and 
`las:organization:cradl/las:model:receipt`. As with the previous API request, ignore all other parameters in the JSON 
request body.

![POST /predictions](/img/postman/postman4.png)

Congratulations, you have now successfully parsed your first invoice using Cradl. The JSON response body should have a 
list of predictions on your uploaded document and the payload should look similar to the following.

```json
{
  "predictionId": "las:prediction:...",
  "documentId": "las:document:...",
  "modelId": "las:organization:cradl/las:model:invoice",
  "predictions": [
    {
      "label": "vat_amount",
      "page": 1,
      "value": "75.72",
      "confidence": 0.9975606850585552
    },
    {
      "label": "total_amount",
      "page": 0,
      "value": "369.00",
      "confidence": 0.9931743085807881
    }
  ]
}
```
