# Parse invoices and receipts

This is a short demonstration of how you can parse an invoice or receipt in Cradl. First, choose which method you would
like to use for document parsing.

<Tabs groupId="programming-language">
<TabItem value="Web UI" label="Using the Web UI" default>

Locate the pre-trained models in the model overview and select the one matching your use case. You may upload your own
document or use one of our sample documents for testing.

<TabItem value="cli" label="Using the CLI">

:::info
You must have the CLI installed. Follow the instructions [here](../reference/cli) to install the CLI.
:::

To parse an invoice in Cradl, you need to make two API calls. One to upload a
[document](../concepts/documents) and a second call to parse the document, creating a [prediction](../concepts/predictions). The
second API call requires you to provide a `modelId`. If you are using one of our pre-trained models they are
`las:organization:cradl/las:model:invoice` and `las:organization:cradl/las:model:receipt` for the invoice and receipt
models, respectively. You can use these as a quick test, but we recommend training your own customized model for
production usage. Read more about how to train a high accuracy model
[here](../get-started/train-high-accuracy-models-on-large-datasets)

```bash
las documents create <your invoice.pdf>
las predictions create <documentId> las:organization:cradl/las:model:invoice
```

Congratulations, you have now successfully parsed your first invoice using Cradl. The JSON response body should have a
list of predictions for your uploaded document. The JSON payload should look similar to the following.

```json
{
  "predictionId": "las:prediction:...",
  "documentId": "las:document:...",
  "modelId": "las:organization:cradl/las:model:invoice",
  "predictions": [
    {
      "label": "vat_amount",
      "page": 1,
      "value": "75.72",
      "confidence": 0.9975606850585552
    },
    {
      "label": "total_amount",
      "page": 0,
      "value": "369.00",
      "confidence": 0.9931743085807881
    }
  ]
}
```

<TabItem value="postman" label="Using Postman">

:::tip
Check out our Postman Collection [here](https://www.postman.com/cradlai).
:::

<h3> Log in to Cradl and create API credentials </h3>

First of all, [log in to Cradl](https://app.cradl.ai/login?redirect=login&utm_campaign=docs) and create an
[app client](https://app.cradl.ai/appclients) and download the file containing client ID and client secret. These
values are needed for authorization when using the API.

<h3> Configure authorization in Postman </h3>

Go to our [postman page](https://www.postman.com/cradlai) and locate our API listed under the "APIs" tab. There should
only be one API there named "Cradl". Fork the Collection and navigate to the Authorization settings of the collection
as shown below.

![Fork collection](/img/postman/postman0.png)

Edit the Client ID and Client Secret and add the values for client ID and client secret that you downloaded in the
Cradl app from the previous step. When you are done adding your client ID and secret, click on the
"Get New Access Token" button and validate that you are getting an "Access Token". Then click the "Use Token" button in
the dialog that appears.

<h3> Upload and parse an image or PDF invoice </h3>

In order to parse an invoice in Cradl we need to make two API calls, one that uploads a
[document](../concepts/documents) and another that parses it and creates [predictions](../concepts/predictions).

To upload a document we need to invoke `POST /documents` with a JSON payload containing the image or PDF as a base64
encoded string together with its content mime type. Cradl supports `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/tiff` and
`application/pdf` content types. Since there is no easy way of converting a file to base64 directly in Postman, we'll
show how you can achieve this using the `base64` program on linux.

```bash
base64 <invoice filename> -w 0
```

Copy the output and paste it in the JSON body as the value of the key "content" and put the corresponding mime type as
value for the key "contentType", ignore all other parameters for now. Note the `documentId` from the API JSON response
body as we'll need this value for the next part.

![POST /documents](/img/postman/postman3.png)

:::info
If you get an "Unauthorized" response from the API, click on the "Authorization" tab of the request. "Type" should be
"Inherit auth from parent", but due to a limitation in Postman we'll have to reselect "Inherit auth from parent" for
the request to update headers from configuring Client ID and secret earlier.
:::

Finally, we are ready to create predictions on our invoice and to do that you'll need to invoke `POST /predictions`
with `documentId` from the previous step and with a `modelId`. The `modelId` determines which
[model](../concepts/models) we are using to create predictions. Cradl offers several out-of-the-box models that you can
use, and they have deterministic values for `modelId`, namely `las:organization:cradl/las:model:invoice` and
`las:organization:cradl/las:model:receipt`. As with the previous API request, ignore all other parameters in the JSON
request body.

![POST /predictions](/img/postman/postman4.png)

Congratulations, you have now successfully parsed your first invoice using Cradl. The JSON response body should have a
list of predictions on your uploaded document and the payload should look similar to the following.

```json
{
  "predictionId": "las:prediction:...",
  "documentId": "las:document:...",
  "modelId": "las:organization:cradl/las:model:invoice",
  "predictions": [
    {
      "label": "vat_amount",
      "page": 1,
      "value": "75.72",
      "confidence": 0.9975606850585552
    },
    {
      "label": "total_amount",
      "page": 0,
      "value": "369.00",
      "confidence": 0.9931743085807881
    }
  ]
}
```
