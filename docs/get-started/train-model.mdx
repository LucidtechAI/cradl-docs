# Train model

## Select and inspect training data

We have now defined a model and created a dataset. The next step is to train the model, but first we need to tell it what data to use when training. At this point, it would also be wise to take a step back and make sure that our training data is of good quality, so that the outcome of the training will be satisfactory. Good quality training data is varied and has lots of examples for all the fields we want the model to extract.

To tell the model which data to use, we select datasets containing our training data and attach them to the model in the form of a [data bundle](../concepts/training-data.mdx). Doing so will automatically create a [data quality report](../concepts/training-data.mdx#data-report) on the training data.

las models create-data-bundle --name "Initial data report" <modelId> <datasetId>

<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/models/<model id>/dataBundles' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "modelId": <modelId>,
    "datasetIds": [
        <datasetId>
    ],
    "name": "Initial data report"
}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
data_bundle = client.create_data_bundle(model_id=<modelId>, dataset_ids=[<datasetId>], name='Initial data report')
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```json
{
  "dataBundleId": "las:model-data-bundle:<data bundle id>",
  "modelId": "las:model:<model id>",
  "name": "Initial data report",
  "datasets": [
    {
      "datasetId": <datasetId>,
      "numberOfDocuments": 3354,
      "createdTime": "2021-08-12T07:18:40.533029+0000",
      "retentionInDays": 1825,
      "storageLocation": "EU",
      "containsPersonallyIdentifiableInformation": true,
      "version": 3354,

    }
  ],
  "summary": null,
  "status": "processing",
  "createdTime": "2021-08-17T07:11:30.430841+0000",
  ...
}
```

A data report may take a few minutes to process. After it has been processed \(its status has changed from `processing` to `ready`\) we can look at the summary to get an idea of how good our data is.

## Request training 

Once you're satisfied with your training data, you can make a request to train your model. Training of models may only be requested through the Cradl UI for now - the API will have this feature publically available soon!

Under your selected model in the Cradl UI, just go to the **Training** tab and click the **New training** button:

![Screenshot of training tab page](/img/train-a-model/training-tab-page.png)

You'll then be presented with your currently available datasets, where you may select the relevant ones for your model to perform training with:

![Screenshot of training dataset selection page](/img/train-a-model/dataset-selection.png)

After selecting enough datapoints and starting the training, you'll see the training job list has been updated with the current model being set as having the status `training`:
