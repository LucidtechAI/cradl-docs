# Setting up a workflow

import { useHistory } from '@docusaurus/router';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import { Box, TextBox, BoxAction } from '@site/src/components/Box';
import BoxContainer from '@site/src/components/BoxContainer';
import HeaderText from '@site/src/components/HeaderText';

import * as Icons from 'react-feather';

export const LinkBox = ({url, ...props}) => {
    const history = useHistory();
    return <Box {...props} clickable onClick={() => history.push(url)} />
};

When predictions are missing or have low confidence, a _human in the loop_ may be needed. In this guide we will cover the following topics:

</BoxContainer>

## Prerequisites
In order to follow this guide, make sure that you have:

1. [Installed the command-line interface (CLI)](/overview/installation)
2. [Created and downloaded API credentials](/overview/authentication)
3. [Created a model](https://app.cradl.ai/models/new)

## Creating a workflow
Now we will set up a default workflow for a model. Before we can do that, we need to find the ID of the model we want to set up a workflow for. The model ID can be copied
from the _Overview_-tab of your model, or you can use the CLI or SDKs:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash" label="CLI">

```bash
$ las models list 
{
  "models": [
    {
      "modelId": "las:model:<my-model-id>",
      "name": "My invoice model"
      "description": "A brand new model for reading invoices",
      ...
    },
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Now that we have our model ID, let's create a workflow:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash" label="CLI">

```bash
$ las workflows create-default --from-model-id las:model:<my-model-id> 

Creating secrets ... Done.
Creating assets ... Done.
Creating datasets ... Done.
Creating transitions ... Done.
Creating workflow ... Done.

{
  "workflowId": "las:workflow:<my-workflow-id>"
  "createdTime": "foobar",
  ...
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the next section, we'll take a closer look at what our auto-generated workflow does.

:::info
Auto-generated workflows are currently only supported by the CLI.
:::

### Workflows, transitions and executions
A workflow is defined by a series of _transitions_ which mutate the state of your _workflow execution_. There are two types of transitions; _manual_
transition which mutates the state based on input from a user, and _docker_ transition which mutates the state programatically in a Docker-container.
At each step in the workflow, the current state is given as input to the transition, and the output of the transition is the new state.
When a new workflow execution is created, an _initial state_ is provided.


## Starting a workflow execution
Let's test our new workflow by creating a new workflow execution. The initial state of the workflow executions is provided as a JSON object, and the workflow we just generated assumes that the initial state is on the form
`{"documentId": "las:document:<document-id>"}`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash" label="CLI">


```bash
$ las create document mydocument.pdf > input.json

$ las workflows execute las:workflow:<my-workflow-id> input.json
{
  "workflowId": "las:workflow:<my-workflow-id>"
  "executionId": "las:workflow-executions:<my-execution-id>"
  ...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that we have created a workflow execution, the following steps are executed:

1. The initial state will be provided as input to the first transition (_Preprocess_).
   The transition will create a [Prediction](/concepts/predictions) on the provided document.
2. If the _confidence_ of each field predicted is below certain thresholds, a manual transition will be invoked
   so that an end user can validate that the predictions are correct.
3. In the last transition (_Postprocess), the _ground truth_ of the document is updated and the document is assigned to a [Dataset](/concepts/datasets)
   so that it can be used for training. This transition is also responsible for _exporting_ the document.


## Exporting documents
To customize the export logic, we have two options:

1. We can use one of the default export options (webhooks or file export)
3. Write a custom Docker image

In this section, we will cover how to use the default export options. Before we get started, make sure to find the ID of the Postprocess-transition:

```bash
$ las transitions list
[
  {
    "name": "Postprocess transition for workflow [..]",
    "transitionId": "las:transition:<transition-id>",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Alternative 1: Configuring a webhook
In order to configure the Postprocess-transition to use a webhook, we need to set the environment variable `WEBHOOK_URI` on our Postprocess-transition.
Updating environment variables will overwrite any exising environment variables that are set, so make sure to include them as well:

```bash
$ las transitions get las:transition:<transition-id>
{
  "transitionId": "las:transition:<transition-id>",
  "name": "Postprocess transition for workflow [...]",
  "transitionType": "docker",
  ...
  "parameters": {
    "environment": {
      "DATASET_ID": "las:dataset:<dataset-id>",
      "FIELD_CONFIG_ASSET_ID": "las:asset:<asset-id>",
      "MODEL_ID": "las:model:<model-id>"
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

Copy the old environment variables plus our new environment variable to a new file called `env.json`:

```bash
$ echo '{
    "DATASET_ID": "las:dataset:<dataset-id>",
    "FIELD_CONFIG_ASSET_ID": "las:asset:<asset-id>",
    "MODEL_ID": "las:model:<model-id>",
    "WEBHOOK_URI": "https://my.webhook.com/a"
}' > env.json

```

Now we update the environment variables for the Postprocess-transition:

```bash
$ las transitions update las:transitions:<transition-id> --environment env.json
```

The next time the Postprocess-transition is run, the result of the workflow execution will be posted to the specified URL.

### Alternative 2: File export (_coming soon_)
Coming soon.
