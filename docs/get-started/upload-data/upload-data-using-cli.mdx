# Upload data using CLI

## Upload documents one by one to a dataset

After the dataset is created we can start uploading [documents](../../concepts/documents.md) and assign them to our dataset. Since we want to use the documents for training, we'll also provide [ground truth values](../../concepts/documents.md#setting-ground-truths) that will define the correct output for the model on each document. Note that the labels in the ground truth must match the field names we defined in our model.

:::caution

It is important to have **correct** ground truth values for every document we use for training. Errors in the ground truth can degrade the training process as the model may learn to make the same mistakes.

You can also assign your documents to a new dataset later through the API.

## Upload multiple documents to a dataset
Uploading documents one by one can be useful for testing purposes, but is not recommended for large scale training datasets.
For large-scale datasets we recommend using the `datasets create-documents` command from the [CLI](../reference/cli.md) . This allows you to upload your dataset in a fast and consistent way, without worrying about looping over all the documents yourself.

### Upload a folder with document and ground truth pairs
In order to upload all the documents in a folder, the following naming convention must be used:

1. each document in the folder must have a corresponding ground truth file in JSON or YAML format.
2. the ground truth is provided in the following format:
```json
[
    {
        "label": "total_amount",
        "value": "100.00"
    },
    {
        "label": "due_date",
        "value": "2021-10-30"
    },
    {
        "label": "vendor_name",
        "value": "Company X"
    }
]
```

3. The ground truth must have the same file name as the document. So if your document is named `a.pdf` the ground truth must be either `a.json`, `a.yaml` or `a.yml`. So your folder will need to look something like this:
```bash
my/new/training/data
├── invoice_a.pdf
├── invoice_a.json
├── invoice_b.png
├── invoice_b.json
├── invoice_c.png
└── invoice_c.json
```
When you have structured your data according to these 3 points you are ready to start uploading your data.

```shell
las datasets create-documents <datasetId> my/new/training/data
```

:::info

If some of your documents are missing ground-truths they will simply be skipped.

:::

### Upload a folder with all the meta data in one file
The other alternative is to specify a file that contains all the paths and ground truths to the documents we want to upload, let us call it `upload-specification.json`.
Below is an example of how this file would look if we only want to upload two documents.
```json
{
    "path/to/document1.pdf": {
        "ground_truth": [
            {
                "label": "total_amount",
                "value": "100.00"
            },
            {
                "label": "due_date",
                "value": "2021-10-30"
            },
            {
                "label": "vendor_name",
                "value": "Company X"
            }
        ]
    },
    "path/to/document2.png": {
        "ground_truth": [
            {
                "label": "total_amount",
                "value": "200.00"
            },
            {
                "label": "due_date",
                "value": "2021-11-30"
            },
            {
                "label": "vendor_name",
                "value": "Company Y"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
In this file, documents and ground truths are represented in a dictionary. The keys are assumed to be a path to a document you want to upload and each value is assumed to be the corresponding ground truth.
We are now ready to upload all the documents and ground truths with the `create-documents` command.
```shell
las datasets create-documents <datasetId> upload-specification.json
```
This command handles interruptions gracefully and can be safely restarted without having to worry about duplicate documents being uploaded.
