# Using the REST API to run flows

In this guide we'll demonstrate how you can use the REST API to integrate your flow into existing systems. All API 
calls will be exemplified using the command line tool cURL, but any tool you're using that has support for making 
arbitrary REST API calls will work similarly.

<br/>

## Prerequisites

You need to have a [Cradl AI](https://app.cradl.ai/) account and have created a flow. If you haven't, go to 
[flows](https://app.cradl.ai/flows) and create one.

<br/>

## Step 1: Acquire API credentials

Go to the [API tab](https://app.cradl.ai/appclients) in Cradl and use existing credentials or create new ones. Read 
more on how to use the credentials to make authenticated requests [here](../reference/authentication.md)

<br/>

## Step 2: Run a flow with a document

Enable the REST API input integration on your flow by going to the flow builder in Cradl AI and locate the `workflowId` 
that will be required to run a flow.

<br/>

### Uploading a document

Next, upload the document that you want to send to the flow. In order to do that you need to create a 
document handle in the API.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/documents 
```

:::caution

Remember to add the Authorization header to all API requests demonstrated in this guide or the requests will fail. Read
more about how to get and add the Authorization header 
[here](../reference/authentication.md#getting-an-access-token-manually)

:::

In the response you'll find a `documentId` and a `fileUrl` which we'll need for the next steps.

```json
{
  "documentId": "las:document:<uuid>",
  "fileUrl": "https://files.api.cradl.ai/las:file:<uuid>"
}
```

Upload the document from your computer to Cradl AI using the `fileUrl` from the previous step.

```bash
curl -X PUT https://files.api.cradl.ai/las:file:<uuid> --data-binary @my-document-file.pdf
```

<br/>

### Running the flow

After successfully uploading a document to the API, we are ready to run the flow with the `workflowId` that you got 
from the REST API integration card in the flow builder and the `documentId` from the previous step.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/workflows/<your workflowId>/executions --json '{"documentId": "las:document:<uuid>"}'
```

:::info

You can give the flow run a `title` by adding a string value for the key `title` in the
POST request. 

```json
{
  "documentId": "las:document<uuid>",
  "title": "My flow run title"
}
```

<br/>

## Step 3: Validate the document in Cradl AI

Go to the [Cradl AI Validator](https://app.cradl.ai/supervise) and validate the document by going to Tasks, 
selecting the correct flow and completing the validation task.

<br/>

## Step 4: Fetch the final result

After successfully running the flow on a document we are now able to get the result from the API. The output of the 
flow run will contain values for all the fields automatically predicted by our AI with potential corrections made by a 
validator. You can now be sure that the document and its corresponding data is correct and use it for further 
processing.

When you made the API call to `POST https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/workflows/<your workflowId>/executions` in step 2 you 
should've gotten an `executionId` in the response. We'll need the `executionId` in addition to the `workflowId` in 
order to get the output from the flow.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/workflows/<your workflowId>/executions/<your executionId>
```

The response JSON will have a key called `output` which contains the final (validated) results.

```json
{
  "executionId": "your executionId",
  "output": {
    "documentId": "las:document:<uuid>",
    "values": {
      "my_flow_field_1": "some_value_1",
      "my_flow_field_2": "some_value_2"
    }
  }
}
```

:::info

Marking the flow run as `completed` will make it easier for you to track which runs have already been processed in 
your system and which ones have not.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.lucidtech.ai/v1/workflows/<your workflowId> --json '{"status": "completed"}'
```
