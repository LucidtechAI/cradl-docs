# Overview

## Installation
The .NET SDK for Cradl can be downloaded from
[nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lucidtech.Las)

```commandline
dotnet add package Lucidtech.Las
```


## Getting started
After Lucidtech.Las is installed and you have received credentials,
you are ready to enhance your document-flow with the las client:
```cs
using System;
using Lucidtech.Las;

var client = new Client();
var models = client.ListModels();
var documents = client.ListDocuments();
var workflows = client.ListWorkflows();
```
If you are new to Cradl we recommend you to check out the [key concepts](../../../concepts/models.mdx)
for a better understanding of what is possible with Cradl.

The .NET SDK is open-source, and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/LucidtechAI/las-sdk-net).
Contributions are more than welcome.
