## Use your models with our CLI, SDKs or REST API
After training and deploying your document parsing model, you can start making predictions on your documents
either through our CLI, SDK or by using the REST API directly from you favorite programming language.

<BoxContainer>
  <div style={{display: 'flex', width: '65%'}}>
  <Terminal
    lines={[
      {
        'text': 'las documents create invoice.pdf',
        'cmd': true
      },
      {
        'text': JSON.stringify({
          documentId: 'las:document:0123456789abcdef',
          contentType: 'application/pdf'
        }, null, 2),
        'cmd': false
      },

## Features

<br/>

<BoxContainer>
  <TextBox title="Accurate &amp; Flexible" width="450px" text="
    Parse any document in any language. Our models are designed for document parsing and learn without requiring
    templates or language specific constructs such as word embeddings or part-of-speech tags. Our team of machine
    learning engineers are working hard to make sure you get state-of-the-art accuracy when training a model on your
    documents.
  " />
  <TextBox title="Trustworthy predictions" width="450px" text="
    End-to-end machine learning models make confidence estimates trustworthy. Our models will learn layouts and reading
    as needed with no intermediate steps, handcrafted heuristics or algorithms. Use confidence thresholds to filter
    predictions that match your desired accuracy.
  " />
  <TextBox title="Reduce time-to-value with historical data" width="450px" text="
    Build a dataset ready for training in short time with simple ground truths that correspond exactly to inputs and
    outputs of model. There is no need for additional metadata such as bounding boxes, part-of-speech tags or similar.
    Provide only the values you wish to extract, not where or how those values appear in the document.
  " />
  <TextBox title="Fast processing" width="450px" text="
    Parse documents with an average processing time below 2 seconds. We take care of optimization and deployment of
    models on bleeding edge hardware offered by AWS so that you always get low-latency processing.

<br/>

<BoxContainer>
  <Box title="Model" icon="/img/cogwheels-gear-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    A model is a machine learning model (behind the scenes) that is configured to extract a specific set of fields.
  " />
  <Box title="Document and Ground Truth" icon="/img/browser-computing-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    A document is a PDF or Image (JPEG, PNG, TIFF) and optionally a ground truth JSON with key-value pairs of
    information present in the document.
  " />
  <Box title="Dataset" icon="/img/share-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    A dataset consists of one or more documents and are typically used to train models.
  " />
  <Box title="Training" icon="/img/database-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    A model training can be done with one or more datasets. Documents contained in these datasets must have ground
    truth defined.
  " />
  <Box title="Prediction" icon="/img/coding-programming-language-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    When a model has finished training it can be used to make predictions on new documents.
