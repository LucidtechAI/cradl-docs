## Features

<br/>

<BoxContainer>
  <TextBox title="Accurate" width="450px" text="
    We design our models in TF2 with no third party dependencies to OCR engines or similar and is not restricted by any
    inherent accuracy limit such third party software might introduce. The more training data you have, the better
    accuracy you get.
  " />
  <TextBox title="Flexible" width="450px" text="
    Our machine learning models are capable of learning any document layout and language. As long as you have the data,
    they can be trained to extract whatever you need them to. Strings, numbers, dates, line items, enums etc.
  " />
  <TextBox title="Fast processing" width="450px" text="
    Documents are parsed in real-time with an average processing time below 2 seconds.
  " />
  <TextBox title="Predictions you can trust" width="450px" text="
    Integrate your trained model in your own software with easy-to-use SDKs or through our REST API. As long as you can
    communicate over HTTPS, you are good.
  " />
  <TextBox title="Feedback loops that work" width="450px" text="
    Cradl makes it is easier to implement feedback loops that enable continuous improvement because our machine
    learning models are trained on the very same actionable data that you need extracted. No need for additional
    metadata annotations like bounding boxes, PoS tagging or similar.
  " />
  <TextBox title="Integrate anywhere" width="450px" text="
    Integrate your trained model in your own software with easy-to-use SDKs or through our REST API. As long as you can
    communicate over HTTPS, you are good.

<BoxContainer>
  <Box title="Model" icon="/img/cogwheels-gear-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    A model is a machine learning model that can be trained to solve a specific document data extraction task, like
    capturing payment info from invoices.
  " />
  <Box title="Document" icon="/img/browser-computing-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    A semi-structured document like an invoice, receipt, ID document, etc. in a PDF or image format. Any language and
    any layout.
  " />
  <Box title="Ground Truth" icon="/img/share-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    A dataset consists of many (typically thousands) of documents that are used to train a specific model.
  " />
  <Box title="Dataset" icon="/img/share-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    A dataset consists of many (typically thousands) of documents that are used to train a specific model.
  " />
  <Box title="Data Bundle -> Training" icon="/img/database-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    A data bundle is a collection of one or more datasets that has been prepared for Model training.
  " />
  <Box title="Prediction" icon="/img/coding-programming-language-svgrepo-com.svg" text="
    When your model has finished training using your Data Bundle it can start capturing data from new and previously
    unseen documents.
