# What is Cradl?

Cradl is a platform where developers can utilize deep learning to capture data from their documents.
Use your own data to train advanced machine learning models through a simple API.

:::info Design Philosophy
Be the easiest way for developers to build _customized data capture APIs_ powered by _deep learning models_.
:::

## Who is Cradl for?

Cradl is built for developers and works best if:
* You are processing high volumes of semi-structured documents like invoices, receipts, forms, etc.
* You require high-accuracy data capture.
* You require low-latency data capture.

## Key concepts
Cradl is centered around the following key concepts which you will frequently encounter in these docs:

1. [**Models**](../concepts/models.mdx). A model is a _machine learning model_ that can be trained to solve a specific document data extraction task, like capturing payment info from invoices.
2. [**Documents**](../concepts/documents.mdx). A semi-structured document like an invoice, receipt, ID document, etc. in a PDF or image format. Any language and any layout.
3. [**Datasets**](../concepts/datasets.mdx). A dataset consists of many (typically thousands) of documents that are used to train a specific model. 
4. [**Data bundles**](../concepts/training-data.mdx). A data bundle is a collection of one or more datasets that has been prepared for **Model** training.
5. [**Predictions**](../concepts/predictions.mdx). When your model has finished training using your **Data Bundle** it can start capturing data from new and previously unseen documents.
