  <Box title="Your first document parser" text="Follow the step-by-step instructions to create your first document parsing API using Cradl. This guide will take you through the basics you will need to know in order to train a machine learning model to parse documents." icon="/img/rocket.svg" width="450px" />

## How can Cradl help you?

<br/>

<BoxContainer>
  <TextBox title="Customizable Parsing" text="Our machine learning models are capable of learning any document layout and language. As long as you have the data, they can be trained to extract whatever you need them to. Strings, numbers, dates, line items, enums etc." width="450px"/>
  <TextBox title="High Accuracy" text="We design our models in TF2 with no third party dependencies to OCR engines or similar and is not restricted by any inherent accuracy limit such third party software might introduce. The more training data you have, the better accuracy you get." icon="/img/hourglass.svg" width="450px"/>
  <TextBox title="Smooth Feedback Loops" text="Cradl makes it is easier to implement feedback loops that enable continuous improvement because our machine learning models are trained on the very same actionable data that you need extracted. No need for additional metadata annotations like bounding boxes, PoS tagging or similar." width="450px"/>
  <TextBox title="Integrate Anywhere" text="Integrate your trained model in your own software with easy-to-use SDKs or through our REST API. As long as you can communicate over HTTPS, you are good. Documents are parsed in real-time with an average processing time below 2 seconds." width="450px"/>

  <Box title="Model" text="A model is a machine learning model that can be trained to solve a specific document data extraction task, like capturing payment info from invoices." icon="/img/cogwheels-gear-svgrepo-com.svg" />
  <Box title="Document" text="A semi-structured document like an invoice, receipt, ID document, etc. in a PDF or image format. Any language and any layout." icon="/img/browser-computing-svgrepo-com.svg" />
  <Box title="Dataset" text="A dataset consists of many (typically thousands) of documents that are used to train a specific model. " icon="/img/share-svgrepo-com.svg" />
  <Box title="Data Bundle" text="A data bundle is a collection of one or more datasets that has been prepared for Model training." icon="/img/database-svgrepo-com.svg" />
  <Box title="Prediction" text="When your model has finished training using your Data Bundle it can start capturing data from new and previously unseen documents." icon="/img/coding-programming-language-svgrepo-com.svg" />
