# What's new in Cradl

## Feb 5, 2024 - Improving the visuals for flow runs.

You can now get an overview on how far your documents have progressed in your flow. The new view makes it easier to 
track and debug flows.

Other changes:
- The PDF viewer scrolls to the page where the prediction is found when focusing on a field. 
- Squashed bugs related to confidence for line items predictions not showing in the validator view.
