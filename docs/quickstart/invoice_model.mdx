# Training a model
In this guide you will learn how to train a model that is customized to *your* invoices, and extracts the information *you* need.

### Prerequisites
1. **Data**, a minimum of 5000 pairs of invoices and ground truths. See [the next section](#2-gather-training-data) for a concrete example.
2. A free Cradl account. [Sign up here](https://cradl.ai).

## 1. Configure your model
First, we need to configure the behavior of the model.
 - In Cradl, go to **Models > New model**.
 - Give your model a name, and add an optional description.
 - Add fields

   **Field name**: The name of the field you want to extract. You are free to choose any name you like for your field, but keep in mind that the field names need to match the names in your dataset.

   **Description**: An optional description for the field.

   **Vocabulary**: The set of symbols that is allowed in a prediction of this field. Smaller vocabularies reduces training time.

   **Max length**: The maximum number of symbols that a prediction of this field can contain. Shorter sequences reduces training time.

## 2. Gather training data
- Prepare training data locally - create pairs of invoices and ground truths as examplified below.


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ground-truth" label="invoice-east-repair.json - Ground Truth" default>

```json
[
   {
      "label": "vendor_name",
      "value": "East Repair Inc."
   },
   {
      "label": "total_amount",
      "value": "154.06"
   },
   {
      "label": "due_date",
      "value": "2019-02-26"
   }
]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="document" label="invoice-east-repair.pdf - Invoice">

![invoice-east-repair.pdf](/img/use-cases/invoice-sample-01.png)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- Go to **Datasets > New dataset**.
- Give your dataset a name, and add an optional description.
- If your data contains personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person directly or indirectly), you need to agree to our [Data Processing Agreement](../administration/legal.md).
- Go to **Datasets > YourDataset > Upload data**.
- Select files and press **Start upload**.

## 3. Train your model
To make sure that your dataset is compatible with the model we will have to create a [data bundle](../concepts/training-data.mdx)

- Go to **Models > YourModel > Data bundles > Select Data**
- Give your data bundle a name, and add an optional description.
- Choose the dataset you want to train on.
- Choose **Create Data Bundle** and wait for the data bundle summary to appear.
- Inspect the summary to make sure that the training data is of sufficiently good quality to start training.
- Go to **Models > YourModel > Training > New training** and choose the data bundle you created in the previous step.

Congratulations! Your model will now be tailored to your data.
You will be notified when your model is trained and ready to use.
