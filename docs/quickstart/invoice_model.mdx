# Training your first model
In this guide you will learn how to train your own invoice model with Cradl. We will use the following [sample dataset](/sample_invoices.zip), but you can
also use your own dataset when following this guide.

:::info
The sample invoices are for demonstrational purposes only. In order to train a good model for invoice parsing, we recommend that
you use a real [dataset](../concepts/datasets) with invoices extracted from e.g. a database or an ERP system.
:::

### Prerequisites
To follow this guide, you will need a Cradl account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account [here](https://cradl.ai).

## 1. Configure your model
Log in to Cradl and do the following:

1. Go to [**Models**](https://app.cradl.ai/models) > [**New model**](https://app.cradl.ai/models/new).
2. Give your model a name and optionally a description.
3. Add three fields _invoice_id_, _total_amount_ and _due_date_ to your model. Make sure that the _type_ of the fields are _String_, _Amount_ and _Date_ respectively.
4. Click __Create Model__ when you are done.

## 2. Prepare training data
Now that you have a model, the next step is to prepare training data. Download the [sample invoices](/sample_invoices.zip) and unzip them to a local folder.
Notice that the files are structured in pairs such as _invoice1.pdf_ and _invoice1.json_. The JSON-file is called a _ground truth_, and each invoice in your dataset
must have a corresponding _ground truth_-file.

Here is an example of how an invoice and corresponding ground truth file may look like:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ground-truth" label="invoice-east-repair.json - Ground Truth" default>

```json
[
   {
      "label": "invoice_id",
      "value": "US-001"
   },
   {
      "label": "total_amount",
      "value": "154.06"
   },
   {
      "label": "due_date",
      "value": "2019-02-26"
   }
]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="document" label="invoice-east-repair.pdf - Invoice">

![invoice-east-repair.pdf](/img/use-cases/invoice-sample-01.png)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution
Make sure that the labels in your ground truth files matches exactly the names of the fields you defined in your model.
:::

In the example above, notice that the due date is written as an ISO formatted date __"2019-02-26"__ even though on the document it is written as __"26/02/2019"__.
This is perfectly fine as long as you do this consistently for all dates in your ground truth. This can also be useful for other fields which require _normalization_,
such as amounts where you can 
write e.g. __"1500.36"__ in the ground truth even if it says e.g. __"$1,500.36"__ on the document.

:::tip Using historical data
Ground truths only consist of labels and values and _do not_ require positional information like bounding boxes. Therefore they can often be 
_generated automatically_ by extracting invoices from e.g. a database or an ERP system. This enables you to train on thousands or even millions
of documents without having to go through a manual labelling process.

## 3. Start training
Now we are ready to train our model.

1. Go to [**Models**](https://app.cradl.ai/models) > **Your model** > **Training jobs** > **New training**.
2. Choose **Create new dataset**. Give your dataset a descriptive name.
2. Upload the dataset you prepared in the previous step. Remember to include both ground truths (JSON) and PDFs.
3. Generate a data report. The data report enables you to inspect your training data to ensure that everything is correct.
4. Leave the default settings and press **Start model training** to send a training request.

Congratulations, you have now started your first training! Once the training is complete, you can start using your model in production.


## 4. Make predictions
Once you have a trained model, your are ready to start [making predictions](test-a-model).
