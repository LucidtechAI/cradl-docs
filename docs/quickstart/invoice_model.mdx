# Training your first model
In this guide you will learn how to train an invoice model in Cradl that is tailored to these [sample invoices](/sample_invoices.zip).

:::caution
The sample invoices used for this guide serves only for demonstrational purposes, read more about data quantity and quality [here](../concepts/datasets).
:::

### Prerequisites
The only thing you need to get started is a Cradl account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [for free](https://cradl.ai).

## 1. Configure your model
First, we need to create and configure our model.
 1. In Cradl, go to [**Models**](https://app.cradl.ai/models) > [**New model**](https://app.cradl.ai/models/new).
 2. Give your model a name, and add an optional description.
 3. Choose the invoice template and press **Create model**.
 4. Make sure that the field names from the template matches the labels in the [sample invoices](/sample_invoices.zip).

:::info Matching fields
To train a model, **the field names always need to match the labels** in the data.
:::

## 2. Upload data
1. Download the [sample invoices](/sample_invoices.zip) and unzip them to a local folder.
2. Notice how the files are structured in pairs of images and JSON. These two components together make up a [**document**](../concepts/documents).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ground-truth" label="invoice-east-repair.json - Ground Truth" default>

```json
[
   {
      "label": "vendor_name",
      "value": "East Repair Inc."
   },
   {
      "label": "total_amount",
      "value": "154.06"
   },
   {
      "label": "due_date",
      "value": "2019-02-26"
   }
]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="document" label="invoice-east-repair.pdf - Invoice">

![invoice-east-repair.pdf](/img/use-cases/invoice-sample-01.png)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. Go to [**Datasets**](https://app.cradl.ai/datasets) > [**New dataset**](https://app.cradl.ai/datasets/new), give it a name and press **Create**.
4. Go to [**Datasets**](https://app.cradl.ai/datasets) > YourDataset > Upload data and upload all the files from the [sample invoices](/sample_invoices.zip).

## 3. Train your model
To make sure that your dataset is compatible with the model we will have to create a [data bundle](../concepts/training-data.mdx).

1. Go to **[Models](https://app.cradl.ai/models) > YourModel > Data bundles > Select Data**.
2. Give your data bundle a name, and add an optional description.
3. Choose the dataset you want to train on.
4. Press **Create Data Bundle** and wait for the data bundle summary to appear.
5. Inspect the summary to make sure that the training data is of sufficiently good quality to start training.
6. Go to **[Models](https://app.cradl.ai/models) > YourModel > Training > New training** and choose the data bundle you created in the previous step.

Congratulations! You have now requested a training. You will be notified when your model is trained and ready to use.

:::tip
Make some predictions on the already active community models [here](https://app.cradl.ai/test) to get an impression of how to use an active model.
