# Training an invoice model
In this guide you will learn how to train an invoice model in Cradl that is tailored to these [sample invoices](/sample_invoices.zip).

:::caution
The sample invoices used for this guide serves only for demonstrational purposes, read more about data quantity and quality [here](../concepts/datasets).
:::

### Prerequisites
The only thing you need to get started is a Cradl account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [for free](https://cradl.ai).

## 1. Prepare your training data
Before we enter Cradl to start the training, we make sure that we have data to train on.
1. Download the [sample invoices](/sample_invoices.zip) and unzip them to a local folder.
2. Notice how the files are structured in pairs of images and JSON. These two components together make up a [**document**](../concepts/documents).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ground-truth" label="invoice-east-repair.json - Ground Truth" default>

```json
[
   {
      "label": "vendor_name",
      "value": "East Repair Inc."
   },
   {
      "label": "total_amount",
      "value": "154.06"
   },
   {
      "label": "due_date",
      "value": "2019-02-26"
   }
]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="document" label="invoice-east-repair.pdf - Invoice">

![invoice-east-repair.pdf](/img/use-cases/invoice-sample-01.png)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Configure your model
We are now ready to enter Cradl and put our data to use.
1. In Cradl, go to [**Models**](https://app.cradl.ai/models) > [**New model**](https://app.cradl.ai/models/new).
2. Give your model a name, and add an optional description.
3. Choose the invoice template and press **Create model**.
4. In the *Model overview* section press **Go to training** and then **New training**.

:::info Matching fields
To train a model, **the field names always need to match the labels** in the data.
:::

## 3. Train your model
You should now be in the training wizard, if not just go to
[**Models**](https://app.cradl.ai/models) > **Your model** > **Training jobs** > **New training**.
1. Choose **Create new dataset**, give your dataset a name and add an optional description.
2. Choose all the files you prepared in the first step and press start upload, remember to add both JSONs and PDFs.
3. Generate a data report, this step will be more important when dealing with real data.
4. Leave the default settings and press **Start model training** to send a training request.

Congratulations! You have now requested a training. You will soon hear from us regarding your training, and you can expect your model to be ready within two days!

:::tip
Make some predictions on the already active community models [here](https://app.cradl.ai/test) to get an impression of how to use an active model.
