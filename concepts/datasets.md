# Datasets

A dataset in Cradl is a collection of [Documents](documents.md), typically from a single source, to be used for training. One or more datasets are collected in a data bundle when you specify which data to use when training a [Model](models.md).

I want to know:

* What is a dataset?
* Why do you want to use one?
* Should you group documents in a specific way?
