# Welcome to Cradl

Welcome to Cradl, the platform where developers can **create custom machine learning models for reading document data**. Use your already-existing data to build your own tailor-made model for extracting structured data from semi-structured documents. Define, train and serve your model on Cradl - **no machine learning expertise required.**

### Structured data extraction

Every day, everywhere, everyone parses information from documents - invoices, receipts, price tags, ID cards. The document formats can vary, the information does not. We want to read amounts, dates, names, VAT details, SWIFT codes, invoice and phone numbers. We _know_ the data exists in that image or that PDF, we _just need to parse it_, but doing so requires a human eye. This is the hallmark of semi-structured data: it lacks a fixed format, but there's valuable information in it _that can be structured_.

Cradl's approach to extracting structured data is _learning by example, not by instruction_. No need to customize stencils and keywords for every single document type - our machine learning models teach themselves how to read the structured data you need from your already-existing collection of documents. All you need to do is upload enough example data for our models to get going, tell them what to look for and sit back as your custom machine learning model gets trained. Oh - and you don't have to worry about deploying and running the model, we take care of that, too.
